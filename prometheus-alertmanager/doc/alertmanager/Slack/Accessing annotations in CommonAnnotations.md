Accessing annotations in CommonAnnotations

https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/notification_examples/#accessing-annotations-in-commonannotations

In this example we again customize the text sent to our Slack receiver accessing the summary and description stored in the CommonAnnotations of the data sent by the Alertmanager.

Alert
```
groups:
- name: Instances
  rules:
  - alert: InstanceDown
    expr: up == 0
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: page
    # Prometheus templates apply here in the annotation and label fields of the alert.
    annotations:
      description: '{{ $labels.instance }} of job {{ $labels.job }} has been down for more than 5 minutes.'
      summary: 'Instance {{ $labels.instance }} down'
```

Receiver
```
- name: 'team-x'
  slack_configs:
  - channel: '#alerts'
    # Alertmanager templates apply here.
    text: "<!channel> \nsummary: {{ .CommonAnnotations.summary }}\ndescription: {{ .CommonAnnotations.description }}"
```
